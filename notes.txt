Test - does it work with multiple groups?
Migration files - can we setup the database automatically locally and in Heroku?

store responses to database via response.serialize
    -finish up the API calls with SQLAlchemy - GET and DELETE, POST should upsert
    -add inboundMessage and outboundMessage storage to DB
    

Need an API for each action from the front end. What does the action do in the database? 
    What should the server figure out? What needs to come in from the API?
Add activeStatus (active, deleted) to Group DB
Stop using _. use snakeCase
Find a way to load message types once at startup rather than every time a message is received (app line 39)


API interactions with the front end:
-accept user sign in request > provide jwt
    /authorize route should accept an inbound Google payload, validate it, and issue a JWT
    JWT should be delivered to client in a cookie
    client session is checked for authorized requests. 
        If cookie exists then validate signature and exp.

        Can I do server-side storage for testing?
            Redis? https://elements.heroku.com/addons/redistogo is free

-display user's home page
    -GET bots
    -GET demographics/settings
-bots
    -POST to upsert
    -DELETE to delete
